# Fork update utilities

These scripts can be used to update your fork of the SAP-samples teched2020-developer-keynote repository.

In fact, the first script `1-setup` sets up the scenario with an out of date fork, based on an existing old fork. It's the second script `2-clone-and-update` which can be used to update a fork so it's in line with the latest changes from the original source of the fork.
